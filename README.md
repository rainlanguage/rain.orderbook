# rain.orderbook

Rain Orderbook (also known as Raindex) is an open source, permissionless orderbook system with no fees or admin keys.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains several components:

- **Solidity Contracts**: The core smart contracts for the Rain Orderbook (`src`)
- **Rust Crates**: Various tooling and libraries for interacting with the Rain Orderbook (`crates/*`)
- **JavaScript Packages (`packages/*`)**:
  - `webapp`: A SvelteKit site for Raindex
  - `ui-components`: A shared component library used in both the webapp and Tauri app
  - `orderbook`: A TypeScript package (published to npm) that provides bindings to the Rust crates
- **Tauri App**: A cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri framework (`tauri-app`)

### Architecture

We use wasm-bindgen to create the `orderbook` package from our Rust crates, which is then used by:
- The UI components library
- The webapp
- The Tauri app

This same package is [published to npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rainlanguage/orderbook), allowing developers to more easily create their own frontends for Raindex.

## New Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic Price Ratio Support

The DotrainOrderGui now supports dynamic price ratio resolution using `${io-ratio(input, output)}` expressions in YAML configurations. This allows strategy writers to reference real-time market prices without hardcoding values.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Automatic Price Fetching**: Strategies can automatically use current market prices
- **User-Friendly Defaults**: No more manual price lookups for users
- **Flexible Integration**: Works with any price API (SushiSwap, 1inch, CoinGecko, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for network issues and invalid data

**Quick Example:**
```yaml
fields:
  - binding: initial-io
    name: Kickoff ${order.inputs.0.token.symbol} per ${order.outputs.0.token.symbol}
    description: Current market price: ${io-ratio(order.inputs.0.address, order.outputs.0.address)}
    default: ${io-ratio(order.inputs.0.address, order.outputs.0.address)}
```

```javascript
const priceCallback = async (inputTokenAddress, outputTokenAddress) => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/price/${inputTokenAddress}/${outputTokenAddress}`);
  return (await response.json()).ratio.toString();
};

const gui = await DotrainOrderGui.newWithDeploymentAndPriceCallback(
  yaml, deployment, stateCallback, priceCallback
);
```

## Setup for local development

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Copy `tauri-app/.env.example` to `tauri-app/.env` and fill out `VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` with a test project ID from [Reown (FKA WalletConnect)](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in)
3. Copy `packages/webapp/.env.example` to `packages/webapp/.env` and fill out `PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` with a test project ID from [Reown (FKA WalletConnect)](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in)

Then run the following to install dependencies and build the project:
```bash
./prep-all.sh
```
You may need to make the shell script executable:
```bash
chmod +x prep-all.sh
```

### Run Webapp for local development
```
cd packages/webapp && nix develop -c npm run dev
```

### Run Tauri App for local development
```
nix develop .#tauri-shell --command cargo tauri dev
```

## Legal stuff

Everything is under DecentraLicense 1.0 (DCL-1.0) which can be found in `LICENSES/`.

This is basically `CAL-1.0` which is an open source license
https://opensource.org/license/cal-1-0

The non-legal summary of DCL-1.0 is that the source is open, as expected, but
also user data in the systems that this code runs on must also be made available
to those users as relevant, and that private keys remain private.

Roughly it's "not your keys, not your coins" aware, as close as we could get in
legalese.

This is the default situation on permissionless blockchains, so shouldn't require
any additional effort by dev-users to adhere to the license terms.

This repo is REUSE 3.2 compliant https://reuse.software/spec-3.2/ and compatible
with `reuse` tooling (also available in the nix shell here).

```
nix develop -c rainix-sol-legal
```

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome **under the same license** as above.

Contributors agree and warrant that their contributions are compliant.
