# Raindex

Raindex is an open source, permissionless onchain order system with no fees or admin keys.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains several components:

- **Solidity Contracts**: The core smart contracts for Raindex (`src`)
- **Rust Crates**: Various tooling and libraries for interacting with Raindex (`crates/*`)
- **JavaScript Packages (`packages/*`)**:
  - `webapp`: A SvelteKit site for Raindex
  - `ui-components`: A shared component library used in the webapp
  - `raindex`: A TypeScript package (published to npm) that provides bindings to the Rust crates

### Architecture

We use wasm-bindgen to create the `raindex` package from our Rust crates, which is then used by:
- The UI components library
- The webapp

This same package is [published to npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rainlanguage/raindex), allowing developers to more easily create their own frontends for Raindex.

## Setup for local development

### Environment Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Copy `packages/webapp/.env.example` to `packages/webapp/.env` and fill out `PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID` with a test project ID from [Reown (FKA WalletConnect)](https://cloud.reown.com/sign-in)

Then run the following to install dependencies and build the project:
```bash
./prep-all.sh
```
You may need to make the shell script executable:
```bash
chmod +x prep-all.sh
```

### Run Webapp for local development
```
cd packages/webapp && nix develop -c npm run dev
```

## Deployment

Contracts are deployed via the Foundry script at `script/Deploy.sol`. The script is controlled by two environment variables:

- `DEPLOYMENT_KEY` — the deployer private key
- `DEPLOYMENT_SUITE` — which contracts to deploy. One of:
  - `raindex` — RaindexV6 only
  - `subparser` — RaindexV6SubParser only
  - `route-processor` — Sushi RouteProcessor4 only
  - `arb` — arb contracts only (order takers and flash borrowers)

Example:
```bash
DEPLOYMENT_KEY=<key> DEPLOYMENT_SUITE=raindex forge script script/Deploy.sol --broadcast --rpc-url <rpc-url>
```

## Legal stuff

Everything is under DecentraLicense 1.0 (DCL-1.0) which can be found in `LICENSES/`.

This is basically `CAL-1.0` which is an open source license
https://opensource.org/license/cal-1-0

The non-legal summary of DCL-1.0 is that the source is open, as expected, but
also user data in the systems that this code runs on must also be made available
to those users as relevant, and that private keys remain private.

Roughly it's "not your keys, not your coins" aware, as close as we could get in
legalese.

This is the default situation on permissionless blockchains, so shouldn't require
any additional effort by dev-users to adhere to the license terms.

This repo is REUSE 3.2 compliant https://reuse.software/spec-3.2/ and compatible
with `reuse` tooling (also available in the nix shell here).

```
nix develop -c rainix-sol-legal
```

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome **under the same license** as above.

Contributors agree and warrant that their contributions are compliant.
